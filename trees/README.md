## Trees
[The task was](tree.py): Build a binary search tree with the letter of the input string. Take it out
on the screen in the form of a tree. Find letters that occur more than once.
Remove these letters from the tree. Display the remaining elements of the tree, with
its postfix bypass.
<br>Since the task required working with duplicates, I have an option where it is possible to add a duplicate. Output to the screen occurs using the matplotlib library
